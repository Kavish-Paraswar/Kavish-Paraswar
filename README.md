## Contributions
I'm eager to contribute to open-source projects, particularly through GSoC (Google Summer of Code) extended projects. I intend to add my strong background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance user experience and functionality in various applications. Additionally, I'm looking to request assignments for UI development tasks to contribute effectively.
